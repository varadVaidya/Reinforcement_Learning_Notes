# Reinforcement Learning Notes

This repository contains the LaTeX notes written by me during my self study of Reinforcement Learning.

This, branch of the notes, also incluedes the notes from teh course E1277 Reinforcement Learning at IISc Bangalore by Prof. Gugan Thoppe. The plan is
to merge the notes from david silver's course and the course at IISc Bangalore, at appropriate places, to make a single set of notes.
