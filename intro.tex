Lecture notes from the various YouTube playlist related to Reinforcement Learning, combined with the course E1277 Reinforcement Learning at
IISc Bangalore by Prof. Gugan Thoppe. The plan is to merge the notes from david silver's course and the course at IISc Bangalore,
at appropriate places, to make a single set of notes.

Since the notes are being merged from two different sources, proper crediting of the two (and many more) is hard. In general, the notes will follow, 
from the standard books of Reinforcement Learning, and are my interpretation of the same.

\textit{Disclaimer:} This document will inevitably contain some mistakesâ€” both
simple typos and legitimate errors. Keep in mind that these are the notes of a graduate student in the process of learning the material, so take
what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling
me, I will be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of
errors. You can reach me by email at
